    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>App:</strong> Battleships Card Game<br>
    <strong>Publisher:</strong> Martin Škorc<br>
    <strong>Effective date:</strong> 15 September 2025</p>

    <p>We care about your privacy. This policy explains what data <em>YOUR_APP_NAME</em> uses and why. The game runs entirely on your device and uses Apple frameworks for optional features like iCloud and Game Center. We do not operate our own servers, do not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs, and do not sell your data.</p>

    <h2>What we collect and where it lives</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>On your device (local only)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>UserDefaults</strong>: stores local preferences/settings (e.g., sound/music toggles, difficulty, UI options). This data never leaves your device unless you back up your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Core Data</strong>: stores local gameplay data (e.g., levels, inventory, progress metadata). This data is stored on the device storage and is not transmitted by us.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>In your iCloud (optional)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>iCloud (CloudKit / iCloud Key-Value Store)</strong>: if enabled in iOS settings, the game saves game state to your iCloud account so it can sync across your Apple devices signed in with the same Apple ID. Your iCloud data is handled by Apple and associated with your Apple ID. We do not access your Apple ID information.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Through Apple Game Center (optional)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Game Center</strong>: if you sign in to Game Center, Apple provides your Game Center profile (nickname, avatar, player ID) to enable achievements and leaderboards. Submissions (scores, achievement unlocks) are sent to Apple’s Game Center service. We do not receive or store these on our own servers.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Sensitive data</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personal contact information (such as your name, email address, phone number), geolocation, contacts, photos, or payment information. Purchases, if any, are processed by Apple.</p>

    <h2>How we use the data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core functionality (save and load your progress, remember settings).</li>
      <li>Enable optional features: cross-device sync via iCloud; achievements/leaderboards via Game Center.</li>
      <li>Improve stability and gameplay based on on-device state (no analytics tracking is performed).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your data with third parties. Data used by iCloud and Game Center is processed by Apple to provide those services. Apple may act as an independent data controller for information related to your Apple ID and Game Center profile. For details, see Apple’s privacy information in your device settings or on Apple’s website.</p>

    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device data</strong> (UserDefaults/Core Data) remains on your device until you delete the app or its data.</li>
      <li><strong>iCloud data</strong> remains in your iCloud account until you remove it via iOS settings or iCloud management tools.</li>
      <li><strong>Game Center data</strong> (scores/achievements) remains with Apple until you manage it via Game Center settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your choices & controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can play without iCloud or Game Center; simply leave them disabled in iOS.</li>
      <li>You can clear local data by deleting the app (which removes the app’s local storage). Consider backing up first if you may want to restore progress.</li>
      <li>You can manage iCloud storage in <em>Settings → [your name] → iCloud</em>.</li>
      <li>You can manage Game Center in <em>Settings → Game Center</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Local data is stored in the app’s sandbox on your device. iCloud and Game Center data are transmitted and stored by Apple using their security measures. No method of storage or transmission is 100% secure, but we strive to use the minimum necessary data and rely on Apple’s built-in protections.</p>

    <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children beyond what is necessary to operate the game features (local saves, iCloud sync, Game Center if enabled). If you are a parent or guardian and believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can help you manage or delete the data where applicable.</p>

    <h2>International users & legal basis (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>If you are in the EEA/UK, our processing relies on <em>performance of a contract</em> (to provide the game and its features) and <em>legitimate interests</em> (to maintain functionality and sync across your devices). We do not perform profiling or cross-app tracking, and we do not sell data.</p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>Subject to local law, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your data. Because we do not run servers and data is local or with Apple, most requests can be fulfilled by using the controls listed above. If you need assistance, contact us.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective date” above when we do. Material changes may also be noted in the app’s update notes.</p>
